The name and number on the referee jerseys represent the new season and I used transform tools to warp them into its natural place. The cherry on top was applying an immersive wave animation to the jersey. The result is a bold, distinctive look that elevates the visuals and enhances the overall experience.",

Line animations and fill gradients were used to illustrate a loading effect when the numbers tick. Additionally, masks outlined team logos and key features to bring them to life. Behind the scenes, I linked a CSV file to update each team's point totals for a seamless export.",
