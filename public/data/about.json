        "Hey there, I'm Christian — a graphics artist and web designer with a passion for visual storytelling. My background as an on-ice hockey official has led me to create motion graphics and design projects for organizations like the IIHF and BCHL, where I bring a unique insider’s perspective to sports branding and communications.",
        "Alongside my design work, I have a strong foundation in front-end development, working with tools like React, Next.js, and Webflow to build engaging, responsive experiences. I also run a social media account dedicated to promoting the officiating community through custom motion graphics and marketing content. Whether you're a design agency or a sports organization, I bring a blend of creative vision and real-world experience to every project!"
