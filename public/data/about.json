        "Hey, Iâ€™m Christian, a creative designer passionate about motion design and visual storytelling. My experience as an on-ice hockey official gives me a unique perspective on the energy and emotion of sports, shaping how I approach visual identity and branding. I bring these insights to social media, where I test design ideas in real-world settings and create motion graphics that engage the community.",
        "Alongside my design work, I build responsive web experiences with React, Next.js, and Webflow. These development skills strengthen my UI/UX design by helping me think beyond visuals and focus on how users interact and engage with digital experiences. Let's put your ideas in motion together!"
